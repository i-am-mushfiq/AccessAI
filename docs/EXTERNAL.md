# External services and environment variables

Every external dependency: why it is needed, whether it is mandatory, what credentials it takes, and
what happens without it. **Nothing in this list is required to run the system end to end.**

The rule applied throughout: an unconfigured service **degrades to a stated fallback or fails
loudly**. Nothing pretends to have worked.

---

## Summary

| Service | Mandatory? | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| Database (libSQL / SQLite) | **Yes** — but defaults to a local file, no setup | — |
| AI provider (Anthropic **or** OpenAI) | No | Deterministic composer; UI badges **"Simulated AI"** |
| Embeddings (OpenAI) | No | BM25 only; `rebuild_embeddings` reports `skipped` |
| SMS gateway | No | OTP shown via `OTP_DEV_ECHO`; with echo off, requesting a code **fails loudly** |
| SMTP | No | Notifications persist and show in-app |
| Map + real places (**OpenStreetMap**) | No — **and needs no key**, on by default | Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_PROVIDER="none"` for a distance-ordered list and an explicit "no map" banner |
| Object storage (S3 / R2) | No | Unused — document capture is not built |
| Voice OTP telephony | No | Button visible, **disabled with a stated reason** |
| OCR | No | Not built |

---

## 1. Database — the only hard requirement

**Why:** everything persists. **Mandatory:** yes, but it needs no installation.

```bash
DATABASE_URL="file:./data/accessai.db"   # default; a local SQLite file
DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN=""                    # only for hosted libSQL (Turso)
```

`npm run setup` creates the schema and seeds it. Point `DATABASE_URL` at a Turso URL plus
`DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` for a hosted database with no other change. The PRD's PostgreSQL target is a
`client.ts` swap — [DEVIATIONS.md](DEVIATIONS.md) §1.

---

## 2. AI provider — the honest-degradation case

**Purpose.** Exactly one job: **rendering a `ResponsePlan` into fluent prose** in the citizen's
language. It does *not* decide eligibility (PRD §24 forbids that), does not choose programmes, does
not compute confidence, and does not author reasons. Those are all deterministic and happen before
any model is called.

**Providers.** One `LlmProvider` interface, four implementations:

| Provider | Env | Model default | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `claude-sonnet-5` (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`) | Response rendering |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `gpt-4.1-mini` (`OPENAI_MODEL`) | Response rendering **and** embeddings |
| DeepSeek | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | `deepseek-v4-flash` (`DEEPSEEK_MODEL`) | Response rendering. OpenAI-compatible; no embeddings endpoint |
| Simulated | *(none set)* | — | The deterministic composer |

With several keys present the order is anthropic → openai → deepseek. Set **`AI_PROVIDER`** to choose
explicitly rather than depending on that order; if it names a provider whose key is missing,
`aiConfigProblems()` reports it instead of quietly falling back to a provider nobody chose.

**Verify any of them with `npm run ai:check`**, which resolves the provider, lists the model ids the
account actually exposes, reports the thinking setting, and performs one real round trip. Guessing a
vendor's current model string is how you get a 404 at request time — this asks the API instead.

### DeepSeek: reasoning is off, by two measures

DeepSeek V4 **thinks by default.** Verified against the live endpoint: `thinking.type` accepts
`adaptive | enabled | disabled` and defaults to `adaptive`, which produced 52–79 reasoning tokens per
call — roughly 4× the output tokens for an identical answer. `reasoning_effort` accepts
`low | medium | high | xhigh | max` and **has no `none`**; sending one is a 400. So turning thinking
off is `thinking: { type: 'disabled' }`, nothing else.

The adapter therefore does two independent things:

1. Sends `thinking: { type: env.DEEPSEEK_THINKING }`, defaulting to **`disabled`**, on every request.
2. **Discards any `reasoning_content` that arrives anyway** — it never reaches the response, the
   `ai_logs` row, or the citizen, and its arrival is logged once as a cost warning.

The second measure is not redundant. A chain of thought contains discarded hypotheses phrased as
statements; putting one beside a benefits decision would present rejected reasoning as advice, and
storing it would pollute an audit trail that has to be defensible. And this product has nothing for a
model to reason about anyway: eligibility, ranking, and citations are all decided deterministically
*before* the model is called — it only rewrites a fixed `ResponsePlan` into fluent prose.

`DEEPSEEK_MODEL` defaults to the **`-flash`** id for the same reason: `-pro` buys reasoning depth this
workload never uses. Switch to `-pro` only if Bangla prose quality matters more than latency and cost.

Measured on a live Bangla turn (widowhood → 5 programmes, 6 citations): **5.5 s** server-side for a
~700-token reply, against the PRD §5 target of 3 s. That is generation time, not pipeline time — the
deterministic path answers in well under a second. Bringing it down means streaming the response
(not implemented — [DEVIATIONS.md](DEVIATIONS.md) §15) or capping `maxTokens` harder.

**Is a mock possible? Yes — and it is the default, because of how the pipeline is ordered.** The
`ResponsePlan` fixes every fact before rendering, so the composer produces the *same* programmes,
outcome, reasons, citations, and next step as a live model. Only prose fluency differs. This is
stated in the UI on every screen, in `meta.ai` on every chat response, and in `ai_logs.engine` for
every stored turn.

```
GET /api/v1/auth/session → { "ai": { "mode": "simulated", "isLive": false,
                                     "model": "deterministic-composer-v1" } }
```

The badge in the UI reads **"Simulated AI (no API key)"** whenever `isLive` is false.

**Degradation is also runtime, not just startup.** If a configured provider errors or exceeds the
45-second abort, the turn falls back to the composer, marks the response `degraded: true`, and tells
the citizen the answer came from the offline engine. A model outage never produces a blank screen or
a lost message.

**Costs and rate limits** are why the `ai` scope is 20/min against the default 120 (PRD §128).

---

## 3. Embeddings — the semantic half of hybrid retrieval

**Why:** PRD §26 requires hybrid retrieval. BM25 matches words; embeddings match meaning, which
matters when a citizen writes *"স্বামী মারা গেছে"* and the programme text says *"বিধবা"*.

**Provider:** OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (`OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`). Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

**Without it:** the semantic channel contributes **nothing** — it is not simulated with a random or
hash-based vector, which would produce confident nonsense. The retriever reports its mode
(`lexical only (BM25)`) in the admin panel, and `rebuild_embeddings` returns:

```json
{ "skipped": true, "reason": "No embedding provider configured (set OPENAI_API_KEY)" }
```

**To enable:** set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, then run `rebuild_embeddings` from **Admin → Jobs**. Vectors are
stored in a JSON column and cosine is computed in process — correct at this corpus size, and
interface-identical to a pgvector swap.

---

## 4. SMS gateway — OTP delivery

**Why:** phone + OTP is the identity model (BDS §10.2.11 — a large share of target users have no
email). **Mandatory:** not for development.

```bash
OTP_DEV_ECHO="true"              # development: the code is logged AND shown, labelled
SMS_PROVIDER="ssl_wireless"      # ssl_wireless | bulksmsbd | twilio
SMS_API_KEY=""
SMS_SENDER_ID=""
```

**Current behaviour, precisely:** with `OTP_DEV_ECHO=true` the code is printed to the server log and
returned as `devCode`, which the UI renders behind an explicit *development only* label so the auth
flow is completable. With echo **off** and no provider, `requestOtp` **throws** — *"SMS delivery is
not configured on this server, so a code cannot be sent."* A citizen waiting for a code that was
never sent is worse than a clear failure. Setting `SMS_PROVIDER` without an implementation also
throws, naming the provider.

`assertProductionSafety()` refuses a production boot with `OTP_DEV_ECHO` still on.

**To implement**, add one function to `sendSms` in
[src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts](../src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts). The three shapes:

| Provider | Endpoint | Credentials |
|---|---|---|
| **SSL Wireless** (most common for BD government/NGO) | `POST https://smsplus.sslwireless.com/api/v3/send-sms` — JSON `{api_token, sid, msisdn, sms, csms_id}` | API token + SID, allow-listed server IP |
| **BulkSMSBD** | `GET/POST http://bulksmsbd.net/api/smsapi` — `api_key`, `senderid`, `number`, `message` | API key + approved sender ID |
| **Twilio** | `POST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{SID}/Messages.json` — basic auth, form-encoded `To`/`From`/`Body` | Account SID + auth token. Works internationally; costs more per BD message and needs a sender that BD operators accept |

A `+880` sender ID needs BTRC-registered masking; without it, messages arrive from a shortcode and
some operators filter them. That is an operational prerequisite, not a code one.

---

## 4a. Voice access — speech to text and read-aloud

**Why:** for a citizen with low literacy, voice is not an accessibility extra — it
is the primary interface. The audience this product targets includes people who
cannot read a Bangla paragraph fluently, and the whole premise is that they can
describe what happened in their own words.

**Mandatory:** no. **Voice navigation works with no keys at all** — intent
resolution is deterministic phrase matching
([src/modules/voice/intent.ts](../src/modules/voice/intent.ts)), so typing or
saying `সংরক্ষিত` routes identically, offline, in ~1 ms.

### The browser is the unreliable part

| Capability | Chrome / Edge | Firefox | Android WebView |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition`) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ mostly |
| `MediaRecorder` + `getUserMedia` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `speechSynthesis` with a `bn-BD` voice | device-dependent | device-dependent | often absent |

Web Speech is Chromium-only, ships the audio to Google regardless, and gives you
no control over Bangla accuracy. `MediaRecorder` is near-universal. So the
server path is not a fallback for exotic browsers — it is the only route that
behaves the same everywhere, and Firefox has no other option at all.

```bash
VOICE_MODE="auto"     # browser where present, server otherwise (default)
VOICE_MODE="server"   # ALWAYS record and upload — identical on every browser
VOICE_MODE="browser"  # never upload audio; Chromium only
```

`server` with no `STT_API_KEY` reports itself as `auto`: configuration intent must
not leave a citizen holding a microphone that can never work.

### Speech to text

One adapter targeting the OpenAI-compatible `/audio/transcriptions` shape, so the
choice is three environment variables rather than three code paths:

| Option | Cost | Bangla | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Self-hosted `whisper.cpp`** | free | good at `large-v3` | Bundled server already speaks this shape. No audio leaves your machine — the strongest privacy position, and it answers the data-residency question the PRD never addresses |
| **Hosted, OpenAI-compatible** | free tiers exist | best available without self-hosting | Only the base URL and model id change |
| **OpenAI directly** | per minute | good | |

There is deliberately **no simulated transcriber**. You cannot fake hearing: an
invented transcript would be acted on, and a wrong income figure produces a
confidently wrong eligibility answer. With nothing configured and no browser
support, the microphone is disabled with a stated reason and the typed-command box
is offered instead.

**Audio is never stored.** It is transcribed inside the request handler and
discarded. Speech about widowhood, income and illness is sensitive text plus a
biometric identifier plus, often, other people audible in the room.

`STT_PROMPT` biases the decoder's vocabulary. Seeding the domain words —
`বিধবা ভাতা, প্রতিবন্ধী ভাতা, টাকা, উপজেলা, সমাজসেবা` — measurably cuts the
mishearings that matter, because a general model has no reason to prefer
`বিধবা ভাতা` over similar-sounding nonsense.

### Read-aloud

Dictation alone is half a bridge: it lets a citizen ask, then hands them a wall of
text. `speechSynthesis` is free and offline but Android frequently has no `bn-BD`
voice, and then it either stays silent or reads Bangla in an English accent —
unintelligible, and worse than nothing because it sounds like it worked.

So `TTS_API_KEY` enables `POST /api/v1/voice/speak`, and **server audio is tried
first** when configured, with the browser as fallback rather than default. Piper is
the usual self-hosted answer for Bangla; it needs a thin wrapper to expose
`/audio/speech`.

Cost is bounded by caching rather than rationing: nearly everything read aloud is
deterministic — titles, condition reasons, next steps, UI copy — so a strong ETag
over `(model, locale, text)` makes repeats free. Verified: a repeated request
returns `304` and the provider is never called twice.

### Diagnosing it

`npm run voice:check` verifies the server half against the live endpoint — key,
base URL, whether the model id exists on the account, a real 0.6 s WAV round trip,
and synthesis. The in-app capability panel (tap the microphone when it is
unavailable) answers the browser half: recognition, recording, server
transcription, speech output, Bangla voice, secure context.

Both containers are tested: Firefox records `audio/ogg;codecs=opus` and Chromium
`audio/webm;codecs=opus`; the route accepts both and names the upload accordingly.

### Not built

**In-browser Whisper** (WASM, via transformers.js) would give account-free
transcription in Firefox with no audio leaving the device. Rejected for now on the
2G target: the smallest usable model is a ~40 MB download and Bangla quality at
`tiny`/`base` is poor. Viable as an opt-in for repeat desktop users.

**Continuous listening / wake word.** Deliberate. Holding the microphone open
drains a cheap phone's battery and records the room after the citizen has
finished, which is not a trade this audience should be asked to make silently.

---

## 5. Voice OTP — the accessible-authentication path

**Why:** BDS §10.2.5 requires a voice fallback for citizens who cannot read the SMS. **Not built.**

The button exists and is **disabled with a visible reason** ("this needs a telephony service") rather
than absent or silently inert — an accessibility affordance that appears to work and does not is
worse than one that explains itself.

**Needs** a voice provider with Bangla TTS or a pre-recorded digit set and a callback endpoint: Twilio
Programmable Voice, or a local operator's IVR. Credentials as for SMS, plus a public callback URL.

---

## 6. SMTP — email notifications

**Why:** PRD §Feature 13 lists email among the notification channels. Secondary here, since email is
explicitly *not* the identity.

```bash
SMTP_HOST=""      SMTP_PORT="587"    SMTP_USER=""
SMTP_PASSWORD=""  SMTP_FROM="AccessAI <no-reply@accessai.local>"
```

**Without it:** notifications are created, persisted, badged, and shown in-app — the citizen still
learns about a closing deadline the next time they open the app. The settings screen **disables the
email toggle and says why** (`emailAvailable={Boolean(env.SMTP_HOST)}`) rather than offering a switch
that does nothing. Same for the SMS toggle.

---

## 7. Maps and real places — OpenStreetMap, no key needed

**Why:** PRD §70 describes an interactive map, and PRD Feature 12 a list of real service locations.

Unlike every other service in this document, **this one is on by default and needs no account**.
OpenStreetMap supplies both halves:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_PROVIDER="osm"    # osm | none | mapbox | google

# Both default to OSM's public endpoints; override for anything beyond a prototype.
MAP_TILE_URL="https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
OVERPASS_URL="https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter"
MAP_USER_AGENT="AccessAI/1.0 (contact: you@example.com)"
OVERPASS_CACHE_HOURS="336"        # 14 days
OVERPASS_RADIUS_KM="25"
```

### Tiles are proxied, not fetched by the browser

Every tile goes through `GET /api/v1/map/tile/{z}/{x}/{y}`. Four reasons, none of them
interchangeable:

1. **OSM's Tile Usage Policy requires an identifying `User-Agent`** and blocks traffic without one.
   A browser `<img>` sends the browser's own agent and cannot be told otherwise, so direct requests
   are both against the policy and liable to be refused.
2. **The CSP stays at `img-src 'self'`.** Adding a third-party image origin for every page in the
   app, permanently, to buy one feature is a bad trade when proxying costs nothing.
3. **The tile host never sees the citizen.** No IP, no referer, no cookie belonging to someone
   looking up a legal-aid office or a hospital. On this app that is not a small thing.
4. **The provider becomes swappable** — `MAP_TILE_URL` moves to a paid host or a self-run cache
   without touching the client or the CSP.

Tiles are cached `public, max-age=30d, immutable`; the coordinates are range-validated against
`2**zoom` before interpolation into the outbound URL, so a malformed path fails locally rather than
costing an upstream round trip.

### Real places come from Overpass

One request per area retrieves police stations, hospitals, clinics, courts, pharmacies, banks, post
offices, fire stations, colleges, NGO offices and government offices — a regex filter over three OSM
keys rather than thirteen separate queries, because Overpass is a shared volunteer service with a
fair-use policy and being rate-limited would take the feature down for everyone.

Results are cached in `osm_place_cache`, keyed by a ~5.5 km grid cell so two citizens in one town
share a lookup rather than each triggering an identical upstream query. Measured on Dhaka: **cold
~20 s, cached ~0.5 s**, 5,240 places after de-duplication. `npm run osm:clear` empties the cache,
which is required after changing normalisation because the cache stores post-normalisation shapes.

These places are shown **alongside** the seeded corpus and labelled separately — see
[DEVIATIONS.md](DEVIATIONS.md) §12a for why they are never merged, and for the three tag mappings
that were deliberately refused.

### Before real traffic

> **Point `OVERPASS_URL` and `MAP_TILE_URL` at your own instance or a paid provider.** Both public
> endpoints are run by volunteers on donated hardware. A prototype's traffic is within their
> policies; a deployed application's is not. Set `MAP_USER_AGENT` to something that identifies you
> and can be contacted, because an anonymous heavy consumer simply gets blocked.

Attribution is a **licence requirement** of the ODbL, not a nicety. It is rendered visibly under the
map, links to `openstreetmap.org/copyright`, and is asserted by a test.

### Without it

`NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_PROVIDER="none"` switches off both tiles and Overpass. Nearby Services falls back
to the seeded **distance-ordered list** with call and directions actions, and says why there is no
map. An Overpass failure with the map on is handled the same way: the seeded list is the primary
surface and still works, and the screen states that the real places could not be fetched rather than
showing an error where the list belongs.

Geolocation denial is a normal state, not an error — the list stays usable and the district selector
remains the primary control. Distances are measured from the citizen's real position when shared
(and say so), otherwise from the district town centre (and say that instead).

Mapbox and Google remain drop-in alternatives: Mapbox is cheaper at this scale, Google has better
Bangladesh POI coverage. Neither is required.

---

## 8. Object storage — not yet used

```bash
S3_BUCKET=""  S3_REGION=""  S3_ACCESS_KEY=""  S3_SECRET_KEY=""  S3_ENDPOINT=""
```

Document capture is **not implemented** ([DEVIATIONS.md](DEVIATIONS.md) §15) — the `documents` table
and the admin indexing path exist, but nothing writes citizen files, so setting these has no effect
today. Validated and ready for the writer. Set `S3_ENDPOINT` for Cloudflare R2, which has no egress
charge and is the better fit for a Bangladesh-served deployment.

---

## 9. OCR — not built

PRD §Feature 8 implies reading a National ID or a certificate photo. Not implemented. It would need
Google Cloud Vision or Azure Document Intelligence for Bangla print, or Tesseract with `ben`
traineddata for a self-hosted option (noticeably weaker on Bangla conjuncts and on the low-light
phone photos this audience actually takes).

**Deliberate position:** OCR that misreads a National ID number is worse than typing it, so this
should not ship without a confirm-what-we-read step. That is a design decision, not just missing code.

---

## 10. Full environment variable reference

Validated by Zod at boot in [src/lib/config/env.ts](../src/lib/config/env.ts); an invalid value
**stops the process with a per-variable message** rather than failing mysteriously later.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | Enables production safety checks |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `file:./data/accessai.db` | libSQL / SQLite target |
| `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` | — | Hosted libSQL only |
| `JWT_SECRET` | dev value | Access-token signing. **Must be replaced** |
| `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | dev value | Refresh-token signing. **Must be replaced** |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL` | `15m` | Short by design |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL` | `30d` | Rotated on use |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | — | `anthropic \| openai \| deepseek \| simulated`. Overrides key-order resolution |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Live AI. First in key order |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | Live AI **and** embeddings |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | — | Live AI. No embeddings endpoint |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-5` | |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-4.1-mini` | |
| `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `text-embedding-3-small` | |
| `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` | `deepseek-v4-flash` | Run `npm run ai:check` to list what your account exposes |
| `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` | For a proxy or regional endpoint |
| `DEEPSEEK_THINKING` | `disabled` | `disabled \| adaptive \| enabled`. The API's own default is `adaptive`, which does think |
| `DEEPSEEK_REASONING_EFFORT` | — | `low…max`. Sent only when thinking is not disabled |
| `DEEPSEEK_EXTRA_BODY` | — | JSON merged into the request body last, if the API changes |
| `OTP_DEV_ECHO` | `true` | Shows the OTP in the UI, labelled. **Blocked in production** |
| `SMS_PROVIDER` / `SMS_API_KEY` / `SMS_SENDER_ID` | — | Gateway credentials |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_PROVIDER` | `none` | `none \| mapbox \| google` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` / `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | — | Tile credentials |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` / `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASSWORD` / `SMTP_FROM` | port `587` | Email |
| `S3_*` | — | Reserved; unused today |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` | `AccessAI` | |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` | `60000` | Bucket window |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` | `120` | Default scope |
| `RATE_LIMIT_AI_MAX_REQUESTS` | `20` | AI scope |

### Production refuses to boot unsafely

`assertProductionSafety()` returns problems that block a production start:

- `JWT_SECRET` or `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` still the shipped `dev-only-…` value
- `JWT_SECRET` shorter than 32 characters
- `OTP_DEV_ECHO` still enabled — it reveals OTPs to the client

A weak signing secret is a total-compromise defect, so it is an error rather than a warning.

---

## 11. Optional native dependency

`@node-rs/argon2` is an **optional** dependency. Present → Argon2id. Absent (common on Windows
without prebuilt binaries) → scrypt at N=2^15. Both hashes are self-describing, so an installation
can gain Argon2 later without invalidating credentials, and a host that *loses* the module fails
closed rather than silently accepting a password it cannot verify.

The first build also fetches the Inter and Noto Sans Bengali font files through `next/font`, so it
needs network access **once**; after that the cache makes builds offline.
